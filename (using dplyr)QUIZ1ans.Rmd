# I tried to solve coursera Quiz 1 answer using dplyr package
## Question 1
R was developed by statisticians working at
##Ans: The University of Auckland
--------------------------------------------------------
## Question 4
If I execute the expression x <- 4 in R, what is the class of the object 'x' as determined by the `class()' function?
##Ans: Numeric
Code:
```R
> x<-4
> x
[1] 4
> class(x)
```
--------------------------------------------------------
## Question 5
What is the class of the object defined by x <- c(4, TRUE)?
##Ans: Numeric
Code:
```R
x <- c(4, TRUE)
> class(x)
```
---------------------------------------------------------
## Question 6
If I have two vectors x <- c(1,3, 5) and y <- c(3, 2, 10), what is produced by the expression cbind(x, y)?
## Ans:  x  y
[1,] 1  3
[2,] 3  2
[3,] 5 10
Code:
```R
x <- c(1,3, 5)
y <- c(3, 2, 10)
cbind(x, y)
```
----------------------------------------------------------
## Question 8
Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me?
## Ans: [1] "a"
Code:
```R
x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE)
x[[1]]
```
-----------------------------------------------------------
## Question 9
Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?
##Ans: 3 4 5 6
Code:
```R
x <- 1:4
y <- 2
x + y
```
-----------------------------------------------------------
## Question 10
Suppose I have a vector x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10) and I want to set all elements of this vector that are greater than 10 to be equal to 4. What R code achieves this?
## Ans: x[x >= 11] <- 4
Code:
```R
x <- c(17, 14, 4, 5, 13, 12, 10)
x[x >= 11] <- 4
x
```
