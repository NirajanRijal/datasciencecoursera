```R
x <- c(4, TRUE)
> class(x)
```
## Question 6

[1,] 1  3
[2,] 3  2

```R
x <- c(1,3, 5)
y <- c(3, 2, 10)
cbind(x, y)
```
## Question 8
Suppose I have a list defined as x <- list(2, "a", "b", TRUE). What does x[[1]] give me?
## Ans: [1] "a"

```
## Question 9
Suppose I have a vector x <- 1:4 and a vector y <- 2. What is produced by the expression x + y?
